# Some vs None

At the heart of the `Option<T>` type are its two possible states: `Some` and `None`. These represent a value being *present* or *absent*, and they form the foundation for how `Option` helps us avoid undefined behavior and null reference errors.

## `Some`: When a Value Exists

When we wrap a value in `Some`, we're saying, "Yes, this value exists, and it's safe to use." This makes our intent clear to both TypeScript and fellow developers: we are explicitly acknowledging the presence of a valid value.

In Carbonteq FP, this looks and feels natural. When a function might return a valid result, we use `Some(value)` to capture that presence.

```ts
import { Option, some } from "carbonteq-fp"

function getUserName(id: number): Option<string> {
  const user = { id: 1, name: "Ahmad" }
  return id === user.id ? some(user.name) : some("Guest")
}
```


## `None`: When There's Nothing

`None` is used when a value is absent. Unlike `null` or `undefined`, which are often used inconsistently or forgotten entirely, `None` is deliberate. It's a signal that we *thought about* the possibility of absence and handled it intentionally.

This clarity leads to safer, more predictable code. Instead of throwing errors when something’s missing, we can explicitly match and handle the `None` case.

```ts
import { Option, none } from "carbonteq-fp"

function findProduct(id: number): Option<string> {
  const products: Record<number, string> = {
    1: "Laptop",
    2: "Monitor",
  }

  return products[id] ? some(products[id]) : none()
}
```


## Why This Matters

Using `Some` and `None` makes it easier to reason about your code. Every time you see an `Option`, you know you're dealing with a value that might not be there, and you're encouraged (or required) to handle both scenarios.

This practice leads to:

- Fewer runtime crashes due to unexpected `undefined` values
- Cleaner and more expressive function signatures
- A smoother developer experience, especially when collaborating in teams

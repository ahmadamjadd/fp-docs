title: Functors & Monads Primer
description: Learn the basic concepts of Functors and Monads before diving into functional programming with Carbonteq FP.
---
Before we explore functional programming in action, let’s take a quick look at two key concepts that show up everywhere in this library: **functors** and **monads**.

Don’t worry you don’t need a math degree to understand these! We'll explain them in plain English.

## What is a Functor?

A **functor** is just a container, a box that holds a value, along with the ability to apply a function to that value.

Think of it like this:

> _"If I give you a gift-wrapped toy and a set of instructions to decorate it, a functor lets you decorate the toy._

In programming terms, a functor is any structure that supports a transformation operation, often called `map`, allowing you to work with the value inside, while preserving the context.

## What is a Monad?

A **monad** is extension of a functor, but more powerful.

It not only lets you transform values inside a container, but also **chain computations that themselves return containers**. This is often referred to as `flatMap`.

You can think of monads as **pipelines for computation** where each step manages its own context, whether that context is an error, a missing value, or something else.

This makes monads incredibly useful when you're writing code that deals with:

- Operations that can fail
- Optional or missing values
- Asynchronous computations
- Sequences of dependent steps

## Monads in Carbonteq FP

In Carbonteq FP, you’ll be working with two important monads:

- [`Result`](/docs/BuildingBlocks/Result/WhatResult): represents a value that can be a success or a failure.
- [`Option`](/docs/BuildingBlocks/Option/WhatOption): represents a value that may exist or be missing (some or none).

These are your **core building blocks** for writing clean, declarative, and robust functional code.

We'll explore each of them in detail in their own dedicated sections, with examples, use-cases, and interactive exercises.
